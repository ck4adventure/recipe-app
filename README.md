### Gatsby Static Site App v0.2

This static site was a project to learn more about using gatsby and static site generators. It also uses GraphQL, so that was fun to learn basic queries for generating pages both singleton and templated.

The site is currently in a POC stage, with basic CSS and markdown formatting, but still needing a good once over to get it a little bit sleeker, especially on long text pages.

### Dev Notes

The dev notes section is the alpha version collection of knowledge I want to be able to review and eventually write a series of blog posts. As a self-taught engineer, I find it incredibly frustrating to wade through the piles of beginner `how-to's` on Medium and other publishers that simply churn the same documentation examples over and over like a cow chewing cud. Nothing new or good will ever come from them. So for me, this is to capture the basics of my knowledge and grow upon that moving forward, in time to be able to deliver quality examples and real world production solutions.

### Recipe App

I toyed with the idea of using a CMS to handle the data entry for a recipe collection. So I stood up an instance of NetlifyCMS on top of the static app and allowed it to hook into the github repo subfolder to add/edit markdown files. Other projects have since come up, and I am reworking the concept of recipe app as a rails project in another repo.
