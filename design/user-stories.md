# Recipe App - Alpha

How do I see myself using this app?

0.1 I want to be able to look up my favorite and most used recipes.

- DATA: markdown or yaml files on github
- CRUD: standard set of recipes, add/update via code editor
- USAGE: site published somewhere and accessible

  0.2 I want to be able to save family recipes before they get lost.

- CMS?

  0.3 I want to be able to edit my recipes and add notes.

- Add additional data for 'attempts',
  I want to be able to convert metric and US measurements when needed.
- Possibly convert to standard DB now
  I want to be able to post images of the things I've made.
  I want to be able to scrape recipes from internet sources.
