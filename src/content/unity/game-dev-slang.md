A few additional concepts that don't fit directly in with C# notes.

### Visual Rendering

- FPS: Frames per Second
- Sprite: a single image frame
- Sprite Sheet: a set of frames that create an animation
- Prefab: complex component with scripts and materials that can be used to create new instances

### Gaming

- DPS: Damage Per Second
- Common stat is also number of Seconds played
- Randomicity isn't all that random, have to actually control for the occasional too long streaks that might harm game play
